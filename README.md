# Indian-Military-Database
Our country is proceeding to a ”Digital Armed Force” and defence forces asked to give serious thought to up- grading technological skills. A cloud database which can store all unclassified information about things like inven- tory list and medicine stock of each military base can be saved in a cloud. This will be accessible from anywhere easily and provide access to find that there is any lack of food or medical resources.
